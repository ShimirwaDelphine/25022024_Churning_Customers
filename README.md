CHURN PREDICTION MODEL DEPLOYMENT

Overview
This project focuses on developing a deep learning application to predict potential customer churn. The goal is to assist telecom operators in identifying customers who are most likely to churn and take proactive measures to reduce churn rates.

Project Components

1. Dataset and Feature Extraction

- This project utilizes the provided dataset to extract relevant features that can define customer churn.
- It uses Python programming language and Flask for creating a user interface (a web based interface).
- It also utilizes deferent python libraries and other dependencies, such as TensorFlow, Keras, Flask, etc.
  
2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

- It conducts Exploratory Data Analysis to identify customer profiles related to high churn rates.
  
3. This project also defines and trains Multi-Layer Perceptron Model using Functional API.

4. Model Evaluation

- It is essential to assess the model's accuracy and calculate the Area Under the Curve (AUC) score for performance evaluation.

5. Model Deployment

- Created a web-based platform for hosting the churn prediction model.

6. User Interface

- The interface for the user is a website, and it is found here: [https://customerchurnn.streamlit.app/].

7. Video Demonstration

- The DEMO video is found here: [https://youtu.be/IzKkJlN9ZrY?si=C-uHsCiV31P9fFyK]. Watch it to understand how the application works.
